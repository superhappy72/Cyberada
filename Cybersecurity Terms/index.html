		<p>Exposure
			<br>
			A security exposure involves a vulnerability or weakness in a system, application, or network that has not yet been used by an attacker but can be. It is a vulnerability which, if discovered by a threat actor, could be used to cause harm. In contrast with a data breach, there is a difference in that with an exposure, the data is only potentially available and has not necessarily been accessed or stolen.
			<br>
<br>
Intrusion
<br>

Intrusion refers to the unauthorized or unwanted access into a computer system, network, or file. It is the successful act of bypassing security mechanisms. This can also be done by an external hacker or by a malicious insider. Intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems monitor and stop activities.
<br>
<br>
Risk Mitigation
<br>
Mitigation in cybersecurity refers to the process of taking steps that reduce the potential impact or probability of a given cybersecurity risk. It involves the implementation of security controls, policies, and procedures. Examples include the installation of firewalls, employee training in security awareness, software patching, and data backup.
<br>
<br>
Honeypot
<br>
A honeypot is a decoy system or server intended to attract and trap attackers. It emulates a real, vulnerable target in order to mislead the cybercriminals. Security researchers use honeypots to understand attack methods, gather intelligence on new threats, and divert the attackers from their actual, valuable systems.
<br>
<br>
IOT: Internet of Things
<br>
IoT - also commonly referred to as the Internet of Things-designates the huge network of physical devices other than regular computers and servers that are connected to the internet, thereby collecting and sharing data. This would include everything from smart thermostats and wearables to medical devices and industrial sensors. IoT security is a big concern because these devices usually have weak security, thus being easy to compromise and use in larger attacks.
<br>
<br>
Backdoor
<br>
A backdoor is a secret way to avoid the normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, product, or embedded device. While sometimes installed by developers for maintenance purposes, backdoors are installed surreptitiously by malware to provide an attacker with persistent, remote access to a system that has been compromised without the user's knowledge. 
<br>
<br>
Ciphertext
<br>

Ciphertext is the encrypted, unreadable output that is produced by an encryption algorithm. It is the scrambled version of original, readable data called plaintext. Ciphertext is designed to be unintelligible to anyone who does not possess the correct decryption key. 
<br>
<br>
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
<br>
APT is a complex, long-term, and aimed cyber attack where an intruder accesses the network and is not detected for a long period of time. The objective is usually not to cause instantaneous damage but to constantly monitor and steal sensitive data over time. APT actors are typically nation-states or highly organized criminal groups.
<br>
<br>
Malware
<br>
 Malware is a generic term for malicious software that is designed to disrupt operation, cause damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computerized system. Examples of viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware all fall under malware. It is the general term for any form of intrusive or hostile software.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  Encryption
 <br> 
  Encryption is a procedure through which readable data, or plaintext, is converted to an unreadable, encoded format called ciphertext to avoid unauthorized access. It relies on an algorithm and a key. Only the party with the correct decryption key can reverse the ciphertext back into its original readable form and thus maintain data confidentiality.<br>
  <br>
   Handshake
  
 <br>
  In cybersecurity and networking, a handshake refers to an automated process of negotiation between two entities, such as a web browser and a server, through which the parameters of a secure channel are established. A very common example is the TLS/SSL handshake, which happens at the start of an HTTPS connection and negotiates the encryption methods to be used, while authenticating the server before data is exchanged.</p>
